# Small Games Collection

This repository contains a few small games I created for fun. Each game is simple, but they demonstrate some basic concepts in programming and randomization.

## Games Overview

### DICE ROLL

This program simulates rolling `m` dice `m` times. It provides the following features:
- **Roll Results:** Returns a list of all the rolls.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Shows the frequency of each value rolled.
- **Histogram:** Plots a histogram of the roll results.

### GUESS THE NUMBER

A classic number guessing game. The objective is simple: guess the randomly generated number!

### RANDOM WALK

Similar in concept to the DICE ROLL, this program simulates a random walk. The walk consists of a series of steps where each step can either move forward or backward.
